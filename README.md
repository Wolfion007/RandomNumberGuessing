The objective of this project is to create a simple number guessing game using C programming language. The game will randomly select a number between 1 and 100, and the user will attempt to guess this number. After each guess, the game will provide feedback indicating whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the target number. The game will continue until the user correctly guesses the number. The game will also keep track of the number of attempts made by the user to guess the number correctly.
